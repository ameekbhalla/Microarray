0. correct geo submission
1. clustering by absolute expression with all 66 arrays (separate dendrogram and heatmap)
2. PCA along multiple dimensions until groups stop segregating

[] clustering by relative expression level of topmost DE genes
[] supervised clustering: take DE genes in one generation and see if they predict clustering in a different generation 
[] TAG glmm
[] Pathway analysis [GO analysis]

[x] Number of DE genes in each generation; also, control-vs-control
[x] Overlap between lists of DE genes
[]  Gene set enrichment analysis [read about options in limma reference manua "10.GeneSetTests"]
[x] correlation of logFC values between DE in different lists
[] above with Manoj's data

[] Find how within-generation normalization affects logFC values
[] How to remove genes present in control-vs-control comparisons: via interaction?
